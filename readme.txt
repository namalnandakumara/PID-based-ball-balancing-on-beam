Ball and Beam Balancing with PID Controller using Real-Time Monitoring and Variable Resistors for PID Coefficients
The Ball and Beam Balancing System is a popular control system problem where a ball must be balanced on a beam by adjusting the tilt of the beam. The goal is to keep the ball at a desired position on the beam, despite disturbances, by controlling the angle of the beam. The PID (Proportional, Integral, Derivative) controller is used to stabilize the system and ensure the ball reaches and stays at the desired position.

Components:
Ball and Beam Setup: A beam on which a ball rolls. The tilt of the beam is controlled by a servo motor or similar actuator.
PID Controller: Proportional, Integral, and Derivative control logic that adjusts the beamâ€™s angle to balance the ball.
Real-Time Monitoring: To dynamically adjust the system and monitor its performance, values like the ball position, angle of the beam, and the PID coefficients are observed in real time.
Variable Resistors (Potentiometers): These are used to externally adjust the PID coefficients (Kp, Ki, and Kd) in real-time, providing an easy way to tune the controller without changing the code.
System Design:
1. PID Control Algorithm:
The PID controller adjusts the angle of the beam based on the error, which is the difference between the desired position (setpoint) and the actual position of the ball.

Kp (Proportional Gain): Determines how much the beam's angle should change in proportion to the error. A higher Kp results in a stronger reaction to the error.
Ki (Integral Gain): Eliminates steady-state error by considering the accumulation of past errors.
Kd (Derivative Gain): Predicts future errors based on the current rate of change of the error.
2. Real-Time Tuning:
Using variable resistors (potentiometers), you can adjust the Kp, Ki, and Kd values in real-time. The resistors are connected to analog inputs on the microcontroller, and their values are used to adjust the PID coefficients dynamically.

3. Sensor Feedback:
A position sensor (e.g., a linear potentiometer) is used to measure the position of the ball. This feedback is crucial for calculating the error in the PID controller.

4. Actuation:
A servo motor is typically used to tilt the beam based on the PID output.

Real-Time Monitoring:
Real-time monitoring of the system can be implemented using a serial interface (like UART) to send the current values of the ball position, angle, and PID coefficients to a computer for visualization and adjustment.
